What is Generative AI ?
===========================
GEN AI refers to algorithms that can generate new content such as text,images and audio based on the learned patterns from existing data.

Limitations
===============

Gen AI models can produce biased or inaccurate outputs if not properly managed.

They require significant computational resources and large datasets, which can be challenging to obtain and process.

There are concerns about the misuse of AI generated content such as DeepFakes and misinformation etc.,


Vector Embedding
=====================

Vector Embedding is a technique that represents words,phrases or data points as vectors in a
continous vector space.

Embedding model in the AI system will take care of this vector conversions.


Large Language Model
=========================

It is a AI model that is trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human like language.

examples : OpenAI,Amazon Bedrock,etc.,


Foundation Models ?
==========================

Foundation models are large scale, pre trained models that serve as a base for fine-tuning
on specific tasks.

Model only knows foundation knowledge.

But still we can train this model on specific task to specialize to make it as a Fine tuned model.



Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
==========================================

It combines retrieval mechanisms with generative models to produce more accurate and 
contextually relevat outputs.

Uses Cosine similarity to find the right data to retrieve based on users query.



Prompt Engineering 
=========================

It is process of crafting and optimizing prompts to effectively guide the behavior of AI models,
ensuring they generate accurate and relevant responses.
